This package contains a small set of simple examples for making request using several Python libraries (urllib3, request, and grequests)

## Execution

To run first create a virtual environment with **venv**: `python3 -m venv venv` (or `python` instead of `python3`, depending on your system)

Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv/Scripts/activate.bat` on Windows)

Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally run with `python3 main.py`
