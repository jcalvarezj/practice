# Espacio AÃ©reo (Airspace path search)

This is a prototype Java project for a game where the player has to guide waves of aircrafts to their corresponding airport. The program can be executed either in game mode (still a WIP) or in auto mode, where the aircrafts will search automatically for the shortest path to the airports trying to avoid collisions with others. The latter implements a customized A\* algorithm for searching paths in a three dimensional space. Source code is in Spanish.

Build on Linux executing **./buildScript.sh**

Execute the generated JAR using **java -jar EspacioAereo.jar**

There are example game maps for loading on the *parametros* folder
